9
00:05:59.103 --> 00:06:04.383
Mornings began. What's this? I've never let sleep freely.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.607
Why do Ramakrishna angry?

15
00:06:23.632 --> 00:06:26.144
If you ask these things of faith or understand the meaning.

16
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.694
And wives about, how well they're about relationships?

00:06:29.796 --> 00:06:32.600
As a child, her father used to take to actually listen to the preaching.

18
00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:36.988
I never get to go straight to her, I talk to her.

19
00:06:37.351 --> 00:06:39.668
Keep a hand in there without one shouted.

20
00:06:40.422 --> 00:06:43.767


21
00:06:43.993 --> 00:06:48.396


22
00:06:53.325 --> 00:06:54.773

We talked about the differences between atoms and resolution combination.

29
00:07:15.262 --> 00:07:17.558
Atomic is a combination small ..

30
00:07:18.862 --> 00:07:20.168
Atomic combination ...

31
00:07:37.513 --> 00:07:39.687

Tomorrow we start a new lesson.

35
00:07:48.756 --> 00:07:51.508
What? Sir, when will you get married?

36
00:07:52.528 --> 00:07:54.298
Do not ask ridiculous questions.

37
00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:55.985
The lesson is to ask the rest of us.

38
00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:59.773
The wedding is very much a lesson, sir? You do not understand.

39
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.811
Prices, what is physics? Someone will have to give money.

00:08:06.718 --> 00:08:10.236
Before you, the past year left for subjects hoses.

What is the reason to throw the boss.

47
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:16.250
Why ..?

48
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.716
Not because a friend asked my sister is ..?

49
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.430

We're not married yet.

171

183
00:18:59.906 --> 00:19:02.238
Consenting sister went to the village.

184
00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:35.957

Then you go and tell lies.

204
00:20:58.405 --> 00:21:02.507
Two months passed during which one would be? What do you mean getting crazy?

205

My mummy, daddy have money. What a mistake, but I think that will take care of that.

Why did not someone trying to have a daughter of my parents built?

1132
01:32:39.367 --> 01:32:40.522
For money?

1133

We have a daughter. I will take care of us well.

Ma'am, ma'am, I deliberately did not.

You do not help saying that.

01:35:09.458 --> 01:35:11.630
Remember, you have a kind of whole life.

1162

No, ma'am, I have changed. I behaved completely.

Hey Vijay! Where are you going?

1458
01:57:32.362 --> 01:57:35.310

1460
01:57:42.167 --> 01:57:44.454

I did not know, you know, I'd like to get. Pulling about Vijay?

1466
01:58:01.691 --> 01:58:06.513
When talking about the marriage of Geetha, said now is the name of my grandmother that she wanted.

1467
01:58:06.739 --> 01:58:09.499
In fact, Vijay. I chose you.

1468
01:58:09.762 --> 01:58:11.629

My sister is happy with you, secure your name's gonna indifference did.

1470
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:18.233
First, though, should have to talk to you.

1471
01:58:19.114 --> 01:58:20.362
brother in law.

1472
01:58:21.739 --> 01:58:24.412
I want to tell you something.

1473
01:58:28.339 --> 01:58:33.851
This one is not looking for you until Geetha siddiyēdi one else,

1474
01:58:38.290 --> 01:58:39.162
I am.

1475
01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:47.740
I felt it was doing that.

1476
01:58:49.671 --> 01:58:51.875
You and I know that, Vijay.

1477
01:58:54.536 --> 01:58:55.852
Sister said.

1478
01:58:57.814 --> 01:59:01.339
He's the ran̆gapǣmakda along with you? I kill ring.

1479
01:59:01.429 --> 01:59:02.606
Brother, please.

1480
01:59:02.959 --> 01:59:05.126
Listen to me. Stay sitting for five minutes.

1481
01:59:05.171 --> 01:59:06.754
Five minutes brother. please.

1482
01:59:07.122 --> 01:59:09.926
Say. What to say? Fun is excited?

1483
01:59:10.819 --> 01:59:12.971
Vijay complaints about the mamanē.

1484
01:59:13.392 --> 01:59:16.610
Like you, I think he's a villain.

1485
01:59:16.901 --> 01:59:18.680
Kill had enough worries.

1486
01:59:19.586 --> 01:59:21.947
But I learned how he,

1487
01:59:27.768 --> 01:59:31.341
The angry, turned into a dying love.

1488
01:59:39.454 --> 01:59:41.140
He's a man of gold.

1489
01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:50.592
So far it's her, ma'am, I was not done deliberately,

1490
01:59:50.802 --> 01:59:53.254
I deliberately did not say how much I did not ask.

1491
01:59:54.357 --> 01:59:56.104
Afraid. Was suffering.

1492
01:59:56.635 --> 01:59:59.740
Cried, panicked.

1493
01:59:59.232 --> 02:00:02.553
Ivasanakoṭa him so, that is not a mistake,

1494
02:00:02.997 --> 02:00:06.940
Do not do that to him, seemed tolerate.

1495
02:00:06.386 --> 02:00:11.305
But if I found a reason to love you know.

1496
02:00:12.764 --> 02:00:18.500
It wiped out our MD's daughter, I hit one out loud, do not you crazy ..

1497
02:00:18.134 --> 02:00:20.174
If ..kivvā, had to hear that.

1498
02:00:21.748 --> 02:00:24.156
Wait.

1499
02:00:25.656 --> 02:00:30.524
If an employer tolerate the woman fortunate no one else

1500
02:00:31.618 --> 02:00:32.901
He is my master.

1501
02:00:34.559 --> 02:00:36.921
https://t.me/TM_LMO

1502
02:00:38.308 --> 02:00:41.849
This is what a good person, the woman is expected.

1503
02:00:42.396 --> 02:00:46.648
That's why, she was in love.

1504
02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:51.927
Geetha's not a choice you, Vijay.

1505
02:00:53.271 --> 02:00:54.636
The only alternative.

1506
02:01:00.929 --> 02:01:03.164
I do not get why you disliked him.

1507
02:01:04.881 --> 02:01:07.500
But that poor and crying.

1508
02:01:08.946 --> 02:01:10.860
I asked,

1509
02:01:11.241 --> 02:01:14.302
Because you do not want someone telling me crying for me.

1510
02:01:16.566 --> 02:01:17.811
You know what did he say that?

1511
02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:22.612
He agreed not to mention brother, I said that I love that.

1512
02:01:25.468 --> 02:01:26.481
Vijay.

1513
02:01:26.886 --> 02:01:28.993
Brother, I'll be back.

1514
02:01:56.410 --> 02:01:59.288
Ma'am, Ma'am, please ...

1515
02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:03.349
Why is she talking to? - Nothing. You say.

1516
02:02:03.413 --> 02:02:05.695
I know everything. Go talk to.

1517
02:02:05.792 --> 02:02:09.600
Was not that important. - I know what's going on here. Go talk

1518
02:02:11.706 --> 02:02:13.345
Once you want to talk with you.

1519
02:02:13.646 --> 02:02:18.270
PS, this problem until it's your family. That's why I will not interfere.

1520
02:02:18.156 --> 02:02:21.770
But I got married I did not expect this kind of behavior.

1521
02:02:21.225 --> 02:02:23.366
Female? The -karāma. Go

1522

1527
02:02:45.434 --> 02:02:49.302
We are men of the third class. Was a mistake. Sorry.

1528
02:02:49.367 --> 02:02:50.963


1529
02:02:52.142 --> 02:02:55.956

02:03:11.128 --> 02:03:12.102

Please, ma'am, ma'am, you tell your granny Madam

1537
02:03:15.885 --> 02:03:18.167
Give her a week full of money, ma'am.

1538
02:03:18.210 --> 02:03:20.782
This is because of sister's marriage nævatunot

1539
02:03:20.867 --> 02:03:24.199

1540
02:03:24.241 --> 02:03:27.338
My grandmother is the last word. If money is the marriage.

1541

1544
02:03:37.634 --> 02:03:41.369


1545
02:03:41.996 --> 02:03:44.899
Want to do something for themselves. - Ma'am, ma'am.

One time, listen to me, please.

02:03:49.763 --> 02:03:53.203
Leave. Leave hand. Away.

Ma'am, have you ever thought it would take me to understand. Do you Care?

1549

Do you understand? Crazy guy.

1550
02:04:02.535 --> 02:04:05.605
Do you understand? You're not understood.

1551
02:04:08.182 --> 02:04:11.160
I do not feel bad when you kiyapudēṭa.

1552
02:04:12.789 --> 02:04:14.589
Finally, what did?

02:04:16.326 --> 02:04:21.982
The marriage was not going to say marriage is not my sister. I told you bound?

1554
02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:25.628
So I do not assimilate it?

1555
02:04:26.523 --> 02:04:29.684
Think marry married to blackmail you? - Ma'am.

1556
02:04:29.803 --> 02:04:34.431
It's not intimidating. I do not understand that gonna say now.

1557
02:04:34.924 --> 02:04:40.709
Was a mistake. Told that was a mistake. Here's over?

1558
02:04:40.967 --> 02:04:44.410
Yes, Cranial.

1559
02:04:44.824 --> 02:04:47.717
From the day I found out that I like you,

1560
02:04:48.756 --> 02:04:53.224
Would you suggest a smoldering? When I was waiting for would like.

1561
02:04:53.652 --> 02:04:57.306
What's the truth, so you respect those women warmer

1565
02:05:13.367 --> 02:05:17.427
Even those like you who are caught. I got caught.

1566
02:05:17.728 --> 02:05:19.217
My sin.

1567
02:05:20.138 --> 02:05:23.310
Kiss was previously associated.

1568
02:05:23.792 --> 02:05:27.681
Understanding love up.

1569
02:05:27.982 --> 02:05:32.471


1570
02:05:39.928 --> 02:05:43.667
But you're so selfish.

1571
02:05:44.234 --> 02:05:47.556
You ātmārthakāmiyek.

1572

02:06:01.933 --> 02:06:06.300
Mother is the truth, God.

02:06:06.669 --> 02:06:07.872
Mother.

1576
02:06:09.317 --> 02:06:12.942
